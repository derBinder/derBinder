# Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am a frontend developer with a focus on Angular and have been working with this technology since 2016.

In addition to Angular, I am also proficient in other technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Javascript/TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, and SQL. I also have experience with CI/CD tools such as Jenkins or Travis-CI, which I have successfully implemented in my projects.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
